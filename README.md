This is a five page website designed to be more like a single scrolling page website project. 
It consists of 6 sections including Home, Cigar Globe, Cigar Journey, Cigar Talk, Cigar Quiz and Contact 
sections. The reason for the extra pages is the Cigar Quiz app that was developed for an enhanced user 
experience.  The main aim of this project is for new cigar enthusiasts to come and visit the website and learn 
about the main points of cigar culture and be able to navigate easily through the website to get to the 
information they require. This website contains simple, easy to understand information to help the user get 
around cigar culture Such as the ‘Cigar Globe’ section where the user can learn about the main cigar producing 
countries of the world. The ‘Cigar Journey’ section has an easy to navigate section for a user to learn and 
understand how a cigar is made from start to finish. Or like the ‘Cigar Talk’ section which gives a list of 
terms they may come across in the early stages of their own cigar journey. The ‘Contact’ section is a simple 
design to allow users to feel comfortable in reaching out for any cigar related questions they may have. I have 
also included a ‘Cigar Quiz’ section as an added extra interactivity for the user to somewhat test their own 
knowledge of what they have learned from this website.
