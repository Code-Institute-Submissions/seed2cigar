                Cigar tobacco begins as a seed, a tiny object the size of a candy sprinkle. The seeds are so 
                small that they need to be pelletized, coated with an inert substance such as clay for easier 
                handling. (The coating melts away when watered.) Many tobacco growers get their seeds by 
                selecting their heartiest plants and harvesting the seeds from the flower that grows at the top 
                of the plant. 
                The seeds' size make them quite easy to smuggle, one reason why Cuban seed has made innumerable 
                trips from the island to such places as Nicaragua, Honduras and the Dominican Republic.

                The seeds are planted to create seedlings. In about 60 days, a seed will turn into a seedling a
                few inches tall that's ready to plant. The crudest form of seedling plot is planted directly 
                in the ground. When it's time to move to the field proper, the tiny plant is dug up and then 
                replanted, a traumatic process that results in great mortality of seedlings. Raised beds provide 
                better results, and planting in trays makes it better still, for the root balls slip fairly 
                effortlessly from the trays and are ready to go into the ground.
                At that stage, cigar tobacco grows at a furious pace. It takes about two months for a seedling to 
                grow into a mature plant, depending on the type of plant. Once harvested, it spends another 40 to 
                60 or so days in a curing barn. After that, it's time to ferment, and then to age.
                But farmers can't go by a calendar for their harvest. Weather, seed variety and other variables
                can affect the crop, and harvest times have to be adjusted accordingly.

                After being planted, the plants are fertilized with a granular fertilizer. Each plant 
                gets a fistful once a week. The fields are hoed by hand, an arduous process in which the 
                fertilizer is mixed with the earth and pulled toward the plant. At the one month 
                stage, halfway through the growing process, (Connecticut-shade) plants are still short, perhaps 
                halfway up a tall man's knee, and it's time to tie them to a support and remove some of the 
                suckers that impede the growth. Workers tie a piece of string to the plant, which they then 
                attach to another string above to help it grow straight. Then they remove, by hand, the lowest 
                group of leaves on the plant, as well as any suckers, the excess vegetation that grows above the 
                tobacco leaves. After the leaves are culled, the field is hoed to push the soil above the nodes 
                created by the removal of the leaves. 
                In the second month of life, the plant grows at full speed. Brutal, sultry Connecticut summer 
                nights may be hell on sleepers, but they're heaven to a tobacco farmer. 
                About four months from its start as a tobacco seed, give or take a few weeks depending upon the 
                weather, the tobacco plants are fully grown and the leaves mature. If it's a broadleaf plant, 
                that means it stands waist-high after the long, tall flower has been removed. Cuban seed is 
                about six feet tall. Connecticut shade or Ecuador Connecticut towers over the tallest of NBA 
                centers, standing 9 or 10 feet tall.

                Then it's time to prime or reap. Cuban and Connecticut seed tobacco plants are harvested in                    
                primings, in which a worker removes three leaves at a time from a plant, working from the 
                bottom up. The harvest is spaced out over several days. As tobacco matures from the bottom of 
                the plant upward, it allows the leaves to be picked at the pinnacle of ripening, which optimizes
                labor usage if every leaf needed to be picked at the same time, a farmer would need a thousand 
                workers on one day and none the next.
                Primed leaves are put onto lathes, or cujes, and hung in the barns. Shade farmers in 
                Connecticut use sewing machines to attach the leaves to the lathes, but in most of the world 
                the leaves are sewn or tied by hand. San Andres Negro and Connecticut broadleaf are stalk cut. 
                The entire plant is hacked with an axe, allowed to wilt in the sun, then speared on a lathe. 
                Whether it's primed or cut, the tobacco next goes to the same place: a curing barn, where it 
                will spend upwards of a month drying and turn from a verdant green into a rich brown.

                Ripe, mature leaves are brought to the cigarmakers. Cured cigar tobacco looks inviting, but 
                it's hardly ready to smoke. It's full of ammonia and other impurities that would make even 
                the most die-hard smokers woozy in the head if they were to smoke such leaf. To remove the 
                impurities and to develop the hidden richness of the leaf, cigar tobacco needs fermentation.
                Fermenting tobacco, as tobacco men say takes one part artistry and one part 
                science. Workers take cured tobacco leaves and lay them on a platform, building waist-high 
                piles known as pilons or bulks, that can contain thousands of leaves. The leaves contain 
                water, and the pressure of the pile which can weigh up to 5,000 pounds creates heat, which 
                transforms the properties of the leaf. Walking into a room where fresh tobacco is being 
                fermented is an eye-stinging experience, due to the ammonia coming off the bulks.
                Fermentation can be quick or lengthy, depending on the type of leaf being worked. Thin, mild 
                leaves such as Connecticut shade go through the process in a few months. Thick, brutish leaves 
                such as broadleaf require a beating to work into shape. 
                Aging, which follows fermentation, occurs with much lower levels of humidity and in smaller packages, 
                minimizing the heat created from the combination of moisture and pressure.

                After fermentation (or between rounds), tobacco is packed into bales of cardboard or wood that 
                weigh around 200 pounds apiece. It's fairly dry when put into the bale. 
                Inside the bale, the tobacco will age, slowly maturing to further round out the flavors that 
                have been mellowed by fermentation. 
                Great cigarmakers such as Padrón, Fuente, Altadis, General Cigar, Matasa, Davidoff and others 
                have warehouses stacked full of tobacco bales. The stocks are essential. A Dominican 
                Montecristo is expected to taste the same today as it did one, two and three years ago. 
                Cigarmakers are blenders, much like the makers of nonvintage Champagne, and most cigars are 
                expected to maintain a consistency of flavor.
                Because cigar tobacco is an agricultural product, it's subject to the whims of nature. As a 
                result of differing weather conditions, two plants of the same seed type planted on the same 
                spot of land and treated identically might taste noticeably different year to year. More rain 
                might make the tobacco thinner, while more wind might stress the plant and make it stronger. 
                To combat the changes, a cigarmaker needs large stocks of leaf to blend out the differences.

                Premium cigars are hand-rolled in factories. Once the blend has been selected, it takes no time
                at all to turn it from leaf to cigar. A buncher rolls one leaf of binder (sometimes two with 
                smaller leaves, particularly in Cuba) around a group of filler leaves, then places the bunch 
                in a mold, where it sits for several hours, being turned several times to avoid having a seam 
                along the side. Once it is firm, its shape secure, the bunch is given to a roller. (In some 
                cigar factories, one person does both rolling and bunching.) The roller wraps one wrapper leaf 
                around the cigar, taking perhaps a minute or so to do the work.
                A cigar roller can make 500 cigars in a day if allowed to work at his fastest pace, but 
                typically a cigar factory manager will limit his workers to far fewer. One hundred fifty is 
                more typical.
                The years have taken the tobacco from seed to finished leaf, ready to be rolled, but there's 
                more to the journey before a cigar becomes a brand. Bigger companies such as Altadis U.S.A. 
                Inc. and General Cigar make dozens of brands, so new creations are a vital part of the business. 
                Often, blends are created by a company's cigar factory managers, then the marketing team figures 
                out a way to sell the best of the bunch.

                After rolling, cigars are banded and boxed for store shelves. Once the cigar is ready, 
                companies promote it to tobacco retailers, often at the annual Retail Tobacco Dealers of 
                America trade show. After getting enough orders, the manufacturers begin to ship the cigars. 
                (In the old days, that usually meant literal boat travel, and the cigars aged a bit as they 
                were shipped, but overnight express is far more common today.) Finally, consumers see them on 
                the shelves.

                    used to hold the cigar together a little better, nowadays they are almost purely for decorative 
                    purposes.

                    it has been aged for a long time. Bloom appears when the oils from the tobacco crystallise over

                    can also be known as an accordion fold. It is believed to be the better folding technique for 
                    allowing proper air flow through the cigar, allowing it to both draw and burn more evenly.

                    <strong>Fermentation</strong> – After the tobacco is cured, it is moistened again and heated to begin the 
                    fermentation process. This helps to both remove any ammonia present and can allow the tobacco to 
                    reach its full flavour and aroma potential.

                    in your mouth after taking in a puff. Milder cigars will not have a particularly intense finish, 
                    but fuller-bodied sticks will certainly leave behind a more distinctive lingering flavour.
